Amy: "Hey Monika, how was your vacation?"
Monika: "Hi Amy, thank you for asking! It was so great! How are you?"
Amy: "I am good. And it's nice to have you back. There was a lot going on the last week. Nick came up with some new ideas."
Monika: "Thanks! Okay, let me hear, what Nick came up with."
Amy: "He would like to have a weekly report of the sale of our webshop by email. He asked, if you could set that up. Could you?"
Monika: "Sure! Should be quite easy to do. I will do this on Monday 16-06-2024. After that he will receive a automatic report every Monday."
Amy: "Great! I was sure you could do that. Do you think Bob will as well be interested into that kind of report?"
Monika: "I think so, but can you ask him and let me know?"
Amy: "Yes, I will ask him and have you in copy within the request."
Monika: "Okay, thank you! There came just a question regarding the weekly sales report in my mind. Did Nick mention any crucial information he wants to have in the report?"
Amy: "Yes, he wants to have all sales and earnings listed for each item and a summary of everything, like having the total numbers of sales and earnings."
Monika: "Good to know. Thank you!"
