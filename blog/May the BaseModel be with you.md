An creative story of ollama-instructor to get you familiar with its intention and approach.

## Welcome to the Ollama farm

Jason, a young Ollama shepherd, lives on the Ollama farm. He takes great pride in what his Ollamas are capable of. These small and large Ollamas possess the ability to store an enormous amount of knowledge and process language in text form, making them infinitely valuable to Jason's customers.

Some Ollamas are very similar and represent a broad spectrum of knowledge; they can be described as generalists. However, there are also Ollamas who specialize in specific areas such as medicine or finance, among others. Additionally, some possess the ability to process images and extract information from them. Furthermore, differences exist in size: The bigger an Ollama is, the more details it can store, provide, and handle complex tasks.
Jason's Ollamas also come with a skill called JSON mode; he trained them in it. This mode puts the Ollamas into superfocus, where they output their responses following strict syntax as structured data (JSON). The JSON mode is very useful if you want to extract information from unstructured text, images or contexts. Once extracted and converted into a structured response using this method, it can then be processed further. Jason takes great pride in his creation of the JSON mode for Ollamas.

Jason selects the best Ollama based on his customers' requirements. He also has to make sure that his customers can provide the necessary resources to keep the Ollamas happy. It is not uncommon for a customer to want to book a large Ollama, only to realize that such an Ollama needs a lot of food. If an Ollama is not provided with enough food, its enormous energy requirements quickly drain its batteries. At best, the Ollama will simply be slow and falter, but at worst it will stop working. 
Jason genuinely understands that both his customers' satisfaction and their Ollamas’ well-being are important reasons why he invests considerable effort into consultation with them.

Jason's motto is: "Happy Ollamas, happy customers!"

Recently, Jason's customers have been increasingly asking about the JSON mode, saying that although the Ollamas output JSON in this mode, the structure of the JSON often does not meet their expectations. They often vary in the kind of how the JSON is structured. It seems like the Ollamas are missing clear instructions in how to perform in this mode.

Jason is aware of his customers' needs and wants to provide them with clear instructions on how to use the JSON mode and how to define a JSON schema for the Ollamas to adhere to. So, Jason started to write down everything about defining JSON schemas, made workshops and handed over a copy to each of his customers. The customers were happy about it and in the first glance all the problems seemed to be solved. But not long after the first successes of Jason's customers they started to reach out to him again. Now they complained about how hard it is to define JSON schemas and validate if the JSON response of an Ollama really adheres to it. 

It seems Jason's efforts have improved the situation considerably but have not yet solved the problem completely. He had to find a solution... 
One night, when he was sitting on his desk, reading all the emails from his customers, Jason was able to define two goals for a new method:

- Simplify the customers' process of creating instructions and JSON schemas for Ollamas
- Make validation of JSON responses a built-in feature of the method

But he had to realise that he was not having this method right now.

Jason asked his customers for their patience as it would take some time to find a solution for their needs. From one of his customers he heard about an old and wise master called Pyda. The customer told him that Pyda was coming from a foreign place known as Rusty Island. The inhabitants, referred to as the so-called "Rustys" - which are actually lightning fast crabs - are masters of clarity. And Pyda stood out; he had gained the ability to charm snakes, specifically pythons.

Jason thought maybe Pyda's teachings from snake charming could help him with his Ollamas. So, Jason planned an expedition and took some smaller ollamas along as companions to learn from this master. "When it works for the smaller Ollamas," he whispered to himself while staying at the fence of pasture and watching over them.

The next day, Jason started his journey with three small Ollamas. All he knew was to head south towards the coast. The journey proved exhausting; they had to climb a mountain and cross a desert. At nights, they slept around the campfire while counting stars. Throughout these efforts, Jason built an excellent relationship with the smaller Ollamas. He asked them for help in making fire and navigating through the desert using star patterns. He was astonished at how adeptly such handy little Ollamas performed their tasks despite their knowledge. However, sometimes he wondered: "Who is instructing whom here now?"

After five days of a strenuous march, they reached the ocean. Upon discovering it on the horizon was Rusty Island. With the assistance of a fisherman, they managed to cross the waters and ultimately arrived at the island where Pyda resided.

Pyda was living in a small cottage near the beach. When Jason and the Ollamas arrived, he was meditating. Quietly, Jason said, "Hello?" to which Pyda responded without opening an eye: "Expecting you, I have been; Jason. Much to learn, you have." Starting tomorrow.
Jason felt confused but also relieved not to start directly as he was very tired and the Ollamas seemed unreceptive today—one of them had already begun building sand castles. So, he lay down and slept until morning arrived.

The next day Jason woke up by the first sunlight with an Ollama under his head. The Ollamas were still sleeping and Pyda was still or again meditating. However, Jason was not sure about that but on the table in front of the cottage was breakfast prepared. Again, without opening an eye Pyda pointed to the table and made Jason clear that the breakfast was prepared for him and the Ollamas. "My guest you are, Jason.", Pyda said. "Eat. Then starting practice.". "Thank you very much", Jason replied and he and his Ollamas sat down at the laid table.

"Work good, you can't, if an empty stomach you have. Crumpy, hungry makes me.", Pyda laughed while standing up and turning to Jason and the Ollamas. This was the first time Jason was seeing Pyda move. "Enjoyed the meal, I hope you did.", Pyda added. "It is very generous from you, master Pyda. Thank you very much!", Jason replied, stood up from the table and bowed to him. The Ollamas did the same.

"Now that saturated you are, start the lesson we can. Need the Ollamas right now, we do not. Let them play.", Pyda said in the round. "Come to me, Jason, and a seat in front of me, have.". Jason was excited and somehow nervous that he might be taught the method he had gone to all this trouble to learn in order to help his clients. So, Jason took a seat on the sand in front of Pyda.

Pyda was looking onto Jason with clear eyes but friendly. Jason felt respect and comfort at the same time, while looking into Pyda's eyes. Pyda raised his right claw and started: "Look, Jason, like snakes Ollamas are, but different they are. Flexible with their bodies, snakes are, and with their brain, Ollamas are."
"Perform as good as you can lead them, both do, and set constraints in the right place, you must."
"Caused by bad leading and bad constraints, bad performance is."
"Teach your Ollamas, you cannot, until experience how to lead yourself, you do."
"Focus, leading needs. So, with focus, we start."
"Close your eyes, calm down, and on your breath, focus. Blend out everything around you, and only on your breath, focus. In this very moment, more important than yourself, nothing is." And then Pyda said nothing more. Jason was awaiting more from Pyda, but after several minutes of silence, he gave up and tried to do what he told him. Jason took a deep breath and tried to focus on his breath.

But that's nothing Jason is familiar to. He never did meditation. Jason struggled to stay in focus as his mind went crazy. He wondered what Pyda was doing while he had his eyes closed. "It must be 20 minutes now", he thought to himself. "Is he looking at me?". Jason opened the left eye a tiny little bit to catch a look at Pyda. "Keep your eyes closed. Stay focused.", Pyda said clearly. "Sense that impatient you are, I can, Jason. Let go. Let go of everything around you.". Jason sighed in thought.

After what felt like an eternity, Pyda finally asked: "Feel that fresh too, do you? A short session like this, a good way to get started, it was, wasn't it?". Jason couldn't quite believe what he had heard. Short? It seemed like an eternity to him. "Practice again, tomorrow we will. See, you will, the progress comes with practice.", Pyda added.

For the next five days, Pyda and Jason repeated the procedure, with the meditation getting longer each day. To Jason's amazement, he found it easier and easier to block out everything around him. He began to like it and enjoyed being able to find something like mental emptiness for once. 

On the seventh day Jason was sitting in front of Pyda and awaited his signal to start the meditation. Unexpectedly, Pyda was not giving any signal but started smiling. "I can see you learned fast, Jason. It seems you enjoyed it and this i making me happy for you.", Pyda expressed.
"Now that you are ready and learned to focus, I will start to teach you about the rules of BaMo."

"Ba-Mo?!", Jason asked incredulously.

On the seventh day, Jason was sitting in front of Pyda and awaited his signal to start the meditation. Unexpectedly, Pyda was not giving any signal but started smiling. "See you learned fast, I can, Jason. Enjoyed it, you did, and happy for you, this makes me.", Pyda expressed.
"Now that ready you are and learned to focus, teach you about the rules of BaMo, I will."

"Ba-Mo?!", Jason asked incredulously.

"BaMo, a concept for leading with clarity it is, where always a Base to start from, you have. Base, the leading part is. With the Base, a clear vision you provide. On top of the Base, the Model you build. The Model, the constraints it defines. See, BaMo made of two things it is: Base and Model."
"Base, the Ollamas to find the correct way will help, and Model, their performance to improve, will help them validate."
"I am not sure I understand, master Pyda", Jason said when he noticed that Pyda didn't want to add anything more. But Pyda smiled, closed his eyes and there was silence.

Jason was confused of this behavior, but somehow he was not surprised either. "However, seems like the meditation session already started", he thought to himself with a grin, put himself into a comfortable position, closed his eyes and followed Pyda's example. But this time it was different. It felt as if Pyda had planted a seed in his mind that had a strong urge to spread. Jason surrendered to this urge and enjoyed how the thoughts all came together and connected with each other until finally a clear picture emerged in Jason's mind's eye. It was a moment of realization. He held on to this image and explored the individual details in order to memorize them. All made sense.

Jason forgot the time around him and after he was satisfied without having the fear to forget any little detail, he opened his eyes and it was already night. “I think it's clear now,” Jason began after a brief period of orientation. “Curious to know what you've learned, I am. Tell me,” said Pyda patiently.

"It's not the Ollamas struggling with the JSON mode", Jason started slowly, "it's me... It's us!". Pyda nodded: "Go on, Jason.".
"The Ollamas do produce wrong outputs, because the JSON schemas are missing precision and constrains. Adding more clarity and information to the schemas would lead them the way to satisfying responses because they perform the best within rich context.", Jason continued. "Pyda, I have it! It was directly in front of me the last hours", said Jason enthusiastically. "I will create a template for creating the JSON schemas with annotations and validation each customer can use easily and enrich it with information for context. The JSON schema will then be used for three things: Firstly, it is a clear instruction what the schema is about and what values are demanded. Secondly, it gets transformed into a form the Ollamas have to fill out. So, this is setting guardrails for the Ollamas. Thirdly, the combination of schema and derived form gives the Ollamas the possibility to validate their own output.". 

Pyda just smiled kindly and nodded. For the rest of the evening, Jason told Pyda in detail how he was going to create this template and how it would all work together. Pyda listened with interest and nodded to confirm that he understood Jason's approach. They both fell asleep late, and Jason grinned the whole night he slept with the Ollamas next to him.

The next day, when Jason and the Ollamas were saying goodbye, Pyda said: “Jason, very happy I am that found what you were looking for, you have. Enjoyed the meditations with you, I did.”
“Thank you very much, Master Pyda!” Jason replied and bowed several times. As last time, the Ollamas did the same. To Jason's own surprise, he approached Pyda and hugged him warmly. Pyda returned the gesture and said: “Recommend that you take the bus home, I would. The nearest bus station, 10 minutes from here it is, and Ollama Farm, only five hours away by bus it is.” And then he just had to laugh and Jason joined in.
